Matrix operations

Mean(weighted mean), median, mode, standard deviation,

Complex numbers from effective java.

Copy intarray var args and intbinaryoperator method to long and double.
Check with intStream.

Math functions should be in different classes. Putting them in IntArray will cause clutter.
Frequency counter. freq counter merge. Immutable class. static factory of Collection<? extends E>, 
Map<? extends K, ? extends V>, array(int, long, double), IntArray, LongArray and DoubleArray static factory
too. Returns a Map<Val, Long>.

Univariate, BiVariate, Multi-Variate with IntPredicate and IntBinaryOperator?????WHAT IS THIS, I FORGOT!!

Provide Supplier for IntArray. So it can be passed as () -> IntArrayOf(new int[]{1,2,3,4});

Kth largest
add(), multiply(), substract()
return all primes, even, odd, composite numbers. (Inside *Array.java classes.) 
Also make static  methods to calculate it. It might come handy.

return all numbers that satisfy given criteria i.e IntPredicate.

*Statistics.java classes should have class Like Min, Max, Mean, Median, Mode, Range and not OptionalInt
Example public Min min();
min.getMin(); returns Optional* because array might be of length 0.

StatUtils

addAll(index, collection)
set(index, value) 
remove(val)
remove(index)
removeAll(int[])
removeAll(Collection)

Prime, Composite, factorial of all numbers,
Quadratice primes, Square root of al, Mapth.pow(intarray[i], 2),
Multiple all
add all
shuffle
foreach with int consumer
fibonacci of all
reverse sort
kth largest
kth smallest
set operations
sort by frequency.

1) Find all even numbers get their squares
